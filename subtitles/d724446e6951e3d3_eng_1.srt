<i>Surrounded by sharp cliffs
on three sides,</i>

2
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:11,051
<i>Windknight's Lot is a former medieval
training ground for knights.</i>

3
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:15,096
<i>Today, the town is
dominated by a prison</i>

4
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:18,433
<i>where its inmates mine for coal.</i>

5
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:22,020
<i>Agriculture and fishing
is the town's main lifeblood</i>

6
00:00:22,104 --> 00:00:25,732
<i>But its population of
517 citizens and prisoners</i>

7
00:00:26,817 --> 00:00:29,694
<i>may soon disappear!</i>

8
00:00:42,249 --> 00:00:46,749
{\an8}<i>Two stars fallen from the heavens</i>

9
00:00:48,547 --> 00:00:53,047
{\an8}<i>Swallowed by waters
swirling light and dark</i>

10
00:00:55,137 --> 00:00:59,637
{\an8}<i>Their ripples move outward,
pulled toward each other</i>

11
00:01:05,022 --> 00:01:09,522
{\an8}<i>The sun will guide the man
who walks the path of honor</i>

12
00:01:11,612 --> 00:01:16,112
{\an8}<i>And for the man
who follows his ambition…</i>

13
00:01:17,618 --> 00:01:19,328
{\an8}<i>…a sacrifice awaits</i>

14
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,459
{\an8}<i>With pounding heart and burning will</i>

15
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,967
{\an8}<i>With thundering fists</i>

16
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:36,512
{\an8}<i>And overflowing bravery</i>

17
00:01:36,595 --> 00:01:41,095
{\an8}<i>He steps forward, free of doubt</i>

18
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:46,772
{\an8}<i>A fate determined by his blood</i>

19
00:01:47,314 --> 00:01:50,775
{\an8}<i>JoJo!</i>

{\an8}EPISODE 5:
"THE DARK KNIGHTS"

21
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:12,505
The townspeople are hard at work.

22
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:15,467
Everything appears calm.

23
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:19,221
But I know Dio is
lurking somewhere.

24
00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:21,890
What happened?

25
00:02:21,974 --> 00:02:26,474
Well, Speedwagon
implored me so earnestly…

26
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:31,521
So I thought I'd help him create
just a small amount of Hamon.

27
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:34,945
But my finger must have slipped.

28
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:38,198
I'm terribly sorry, Speedwagon.

29
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,492
W-Why…you…

30
00:02:51,128 --> 00:02:53,130
Baron Zeppeli, he's just a lad.

31
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:56,759
Rather spry for
a young bag snatcher, eh?

32
00:02:56,842 --> 00:02:59,261
Don't just stand there ogling!

33
00:02:59,428 --> 00:03:02,389
All of our money is in that bag!

34
00:03:02,431 --> 00:03:04,391
That little devil!

35
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:07,310
A grab and dash in a single move.

36
00:03:07,394 --> 00:03:08,228
Let's see…

37
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,982
I think he can serve us as a guide.

38
00:03:30,626 --> 00:03:32,794
H-He's not sinking!

39
00:03:38,008 --> 00:03:40,468
JoJo, the water's up to your knees!

40
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,514
Your Hamon energy
isn't quite there!

41
00:03:57,778 --> 00:03:59,780
What a fine reverberation, JoJo.

42
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:03,158
You transmitted
your Overdrive perfectly.

43
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,410
Do you think this is the spot?

44
00:04:05,452 --> 00:04:08,580
No, a couple of steps to the left.

45
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:10,165
I'll bet two quid on it.

46
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,630
Ouch!

47
00:04:17,464 --> 00:04:18,715
Nice catch!

48
00:04:19,383 --> 00:04:21,301
H-Huh? What's going on?

49
00:04:21,385 --> 00:04:22,886
Who are you?

50
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,055
Something's odd about the boy.

51
00:04:26,515 --> 00:04:28,350
Perhaps too much Hamon?

52
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:32,104
He's not the only thing
peculiar here.

53
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,564
Look around.

54
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,400
This is…!

55
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:37,568
A graveyard!

56
00:04:40,654 --> 00:04:45,154
It seems we're the ones who've
fallen right into the catcher's mitt.

57
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,038
The boy was under
some sort of hypnosis.

58
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,874
Mr. Joestar, above you!

59
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,883
The sun has set.

60
00:05:01,675 --> 00:05:04,052
Time for your lives
to disappear with it!

61
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:05,720
Dio!

62
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:11,184
T-They're crawling out!

63
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,565
I-I've been preparing myself
for this moment.

64
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:19,234
But this feeling of dread…

65
00:05:19,526 --> 00:05:20,860
I'm pouring sweat!

66
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:24,990
And that arrogant monster is
standing there in the flesh!

67
00:05:25,824 --> 00:05:29,911
He repaid Lord Joestar's fatherly love
with bloodstained betrayal!

68
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:32,622
His deeds will not go unpunished!

69
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,084
So that is Dio.

70
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:40,255
I see. He and his zombies
can't function during daylight.

71
00:05:40,714 --> 00:05:43,842
So he hypnotized the boy
and lured us

72
00:05:43,884 --> 00:05:48,054
to a location where
he has the advantage.

73
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,600
A man of such guile must never
be in possession of the mask.

74
00:05:52,017 --> 00:05:55,270
We must destroy him!

75
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,696
Zombie knights!

76
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:05,447
Tell me your name!

77
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:06,740
P-Poco!

78
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:08,116
All right, Poco.

79
00:06:08,742 --> 00:06:10,744
Hang on tight!

80
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:12,287
Let's move, JoJo!

81
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:12,913
Yes, sir!

82
00:06:20,587 --> 00:06:22,130
Zoom Punch!

83
00:06:22,756 --> 00:06:24,132
Amazing!

84
00:06:32,808 --> 00:06:34,684
Dio Brando…

85
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,815
We've never met.

86
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:44,194
But I say this to the mask
that has awakened you.

87
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:46,488
We meet at last!

88
00:06:48,365 --> 00:06:49,991
Hey, baby!

89
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,828
Plan on fighting from
that precarious perch?

90
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:53,995
Come down to meet me!

91
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,082
Don't push your luck, insect.

92
00:06:57,124 --> 00:06:59,126
I stand, at the summit
of the living world,

93
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:02,421
a new organism born
for a new future!

94
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:06,508
As if I could lower myself to
the level of some pathetic human!

95
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:15,471
He's overwhelmingly evil!
A pure tyrant!

96
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:19,729
Once this wound has healed,

97
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,858
I will be free from all remnants
of that battle with JoJo.

98
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,443
Come, conjurer!

99
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:28,447
Your blood shall salve this wound!

100
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:33,197
Bastard! How many lives
have you ended to mend those scars?

101
00:07:33,994 --> 00:07:38,494
How many slices of bread
have you eaten in your lifetime?

102
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,209
Dio!

103
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,545
Baron Zeppeli!

104
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,505
I will handle this.

105
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,473
You will suffer!

106
00:08:03,565 --> 00:08:05,733
Solar Hamon, shine on me!

107
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,028
Sunlight Yellow Overdrive!

108
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:10,614
He did it!

109
00:08:10,697 --> 00:08:12,907
The Hamon is rippling
through Dio's arm!

110
00:08:18,872 --> 00:08:20,915
Weakling! Weakling!

111
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,751
I-It's freezing!

112
00:08:24,753 --> 00:08:25,795
No!

113
00:08:30,717 --> 00:08:32,427
Zeppeli was it?

114
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:37,015
I see your energy depends on
the flow of your blood.

115
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:41,728
If I freeze your veins,
you will be powerless.

116
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:48,230
Know this—I have complete control
over my body.

117
00:08:48,777 --> 00:08:51,821
I vaporized the moisture
in my arm after you touched it.

118
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:55,366
When the water vaporized,
it absorbed heat,

119
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,619
instantly freezing your arm.

120
00:08:58,078 --> 00:08:58,870
And now!

121
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,708
Fool!

122
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,250
I'll crush your skull like a vase!

123
00:09:10,674 --> 00:09:13,718
Dio, I'm cutting short
your vile ambition!

124
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,182
Dio, I feel your wicked blood
coursing through your veins.

125
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,310
I'll take that as a compliment.

126
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:26,648
You've done well
to stop my fist.

127
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,608
You've certainly grown stronger.

128
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,027
JoJo!

129
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:36,570
JoJo, if I were you,
I'd keep my hands to myself.

130
00:09:37,284 --> 00:09:39,077
Take this, Dio!

131
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:51,002
The evaporation has frozen your veins.
Blood is cut off to your arm!

132
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:54,843
Your Hamon energy is worthless!

133
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,636
<i>H-He's too strong!</i>

134
00:09:56,678 --> 00:10:00,473
<i>He's five times as strong
as both of us together!</i>

135
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:04,186
<i>No! He'll freeze JoJo's arm
just like mine!</i>

136
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,730
<i>I can't let him hurt JoJo!</i>

137
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:14,947
Baron Zeppeli!

138
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,203
T-This can't be!

139
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,046
S-So cold!

140
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:33,381
It's so cold it burns!

141
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:36,551
My skin is peeling…
It's as if I touched freezing metal!

142
00:10:36,843 --> 00:10:38,886
Baron Zeppeli's arm!

143
00:10:39,304 --> 00:10:41,889
Without circulation, it will rot!

144
00:10:42,015 --> 00:10:43,182
He's invincible!

145
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,518
We can't use the Hamon of the Sun
to defeat him!

146
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,479
Is there another way?!

147
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,773
Hamon?

148
00:10:50,357 --> 00:10:52,108
Breathing techniques?

149
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,279
If you want to huff and puff…

150
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,116
T-The ground is shaking!

151
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:03,369
…a much more suitable tribute
would be fanfare!

152
00:11:03,787 --> 00:11:06,039
Tarukus! Dark Knight Blueford!

153
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:09,417
This fight is beneath me. Arise!

154
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:13,087
May their screams be my fanfare!

155
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,527
These demons!

156
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,198
Poco, hide!

157
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:47,201
In the 16th century, an ill-fated queen
was slain by Elizabeth I.

158
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:51,084
You, fierce knights who served
Queen Mary Stuart!

159
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,544
Settle this!

160
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:56,423
Exterminate these pests!

161
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,382
Do with them as you wish.

162
00:12:00,844 --> 00:12:05,265
He lifted and crushed that boulder
with one finger!

163
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:09,602
Those two zombies
are heading for JoJo!

164
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,650
T-There's no way
he can fight them both.

165
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,111
If only blood was flowing
through my arm…

166
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,446
And if it was?

167
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:22,031
I could use my breathing technique
to heal my arm.

168
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:25,118
I must thaw…

169
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:32,830
Baron Zeppeli, all you need
is heat, right?

170
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,961
Y-You have a plan?!

171
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,049
How about this?!

172
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,967
Speedwagon!

173
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:45,388
In the Arctic,
people treat frostbite

174
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,349
by warming the affected areas
inside the body of a seal!

175
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,020
Zoom Punch!

176
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,564
Your blood is mine!

177
00:12:59,277 --> 00:13:01,654
H-He's draining my blood!

178
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,283
Speedwagon, I …

179
00:13:05,575 --> 00:13:10,075
I didn't come here
to slow you and Mr. Joestar down!

180
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,917
If you want to drink my blood,

181
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,295
then you'll have to lap up
some Hamon too!

182
00:13:17,587 --> 00:13:21,048
Sunlight Yellow Overdrive!

183
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:23,426
It's not working!

184
00:13:23,468 --> 00:13:26,554
Is this bloodsucker
weakening my Hamon?!

185
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,474
I was wrong about you.

186
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:32,519
I thought you'd turn tail and run
at the first sign of danger.

187
00:13:32,602 --> 00:13:33,853
I apologize.

188
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:37,190
Thank me when this fighting's over
and we're still alive!

189
00:13:45,323 --> 00:13:49,118
Quickly! I-I must heal these wounds
and return to fighting form!

190
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,706
This knight's more chilling than
that bloody frozen arm of yours!

191
00:13:52,789 --> 00:13:57,289
That blade dwarfs
Jonathan's 195 cm frame!

192
00:13:57,502 --> 00:14:01,547
And that strange hair!
Those faces!

193
00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:03,216
They're hiding something!

194
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,218
I've known many a fellow in my day,

195
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,971
and there's something overwhelmingly
sinister about those two!

196
00:14:08,972 --> 00:14:13,472
Every Englishman knows the legendary
knights Tarukus and Blueford.

197
00:14:14,644 --> 00:14:17,480
Even history bows to my will!

198
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:21,067
<i>Long ago, in around 1565,</i>

199
00:14:21,109 --> 00:14:24,028
<i>two monarchs were
contesting the throne:</i>

200
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,572
<i>Queen Elizabeth I…</i>

201
00:14:26,656 --> 00:14:30,201
<i>and the beautiful,
23-year-old Mary Stuart.</i>

202
00:14:30,577 --> 00:14:35,077
<i>The great knights Tarukus and Blueford
were her loyal vassals.</i>

203
00:14:35,415 --> 00:14:39,915
<i>After losing their families in the war,
the knights found refuge with Mary</i>

204
00:14:41,671 --> 00:14:44,965
<i>Regardless of strength,
a man seeks respite.</i>

205
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,844
<i>Not in romance,
but in something greater.</i>

206
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:49,929
<i>Mary gave them hope.</i>

207
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:54,722
<i>To her they swore their loyalty
and their lives.</i>

208
00:14:55,393 --> 00:14:59,893
<i>But tragedy struck when Mary lost
her husband, Lord Darnley, unexpectedly</i>

209
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:04,732
<i>For Elizabeth, luck had struck.
Elizabeth accused Mary of mariticide.</i>

210
00:15:05,028 --> 00:15:09,528
<i>The country turned against her,
and Mary was finally imprisoned</i>

211
00:15:10,992 --> 00:15:14,870
<i>Tarukus and Blueford
fought to free her.</i>

212
00:15:15,121 --> 00:15:18,958
<i>So Elizabeth bargained
with the two thorns in her side.</i>

213
00:15:20,335 --> 00:15:23,129
Turn yourselves in.

214
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:26,716
Then, and only then,
I shall spare Mary's life.

215
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:30,636
We cannot refuse.

216
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:33,014
I have no regrets.

217
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:35,057
<i>The two were arrested…</i>

218
00:15:35,725 --> 00:15:37,476
<i>…and executed</i>

219
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:45,606
Allow me to send you blokes to hell with
a few last words: Mary's already dead!

220
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,238
You's were tricked!

221
00:15:48,321 --> 00:15:52,158
See that lying over there
like a pile of rubbish?

222
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:54,911
That's your Mary.

223
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:06,001
Damn you to hell, Elizabeth!
You betrayed us!

224
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:11,465
With my final breath I curse you
and all of your descendants!

225
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:15,515
I lay my curse upon you!

226
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:21,020
<i>The knights were beheaded</i>

227
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,774
<i>It's said Tarukus's neck
was so stiff with fury,</i>

228
00:16:24,816 --> 00:16:29,111
<i>that the executioner broke several axes.</i>

229
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:33,491
<i>As for Blueford, his hair supposedly
coiled around his executioner's leg…</i>

230
00:16:33,533 --> 00:16:36,619
<i>digging into his killer's flesh.</i>

231
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:41,624
Their betrayal gave me goose bumps.

232
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:46,045
These legendary heroes
cursed the world.

233
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:48,506
I dug them up and gave them life!

234
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:53,011
Life as revenants
the devil himself would fear!

235
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,890
We swear loyalty to Master Dio!

236
00:16:56,932 --> 00:17:01,432
We have come to end the world!
Death to everyone!

237
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:06,395
S-Such hatred!
Their scorn is growing!

238
00:17:09,235 --> 00:17:11,779
Dio's made heroes into monsters!

239
00:17:11,863 --> 00:17:14,866
Can we overcome their betrayal?

240
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:20,371
This Hamon of the flame…
I feel it intensifying!

241
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:24,709
Scarlet Overdrive!

242
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,339
A-Astounding!

243
00:17:29,756 --> 00:17:34,256
I-I had forgotten about
Mr. Joestar's burden!

244
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:37,763
His father's death
and his hope for the future!

245
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,725
Our hope!

246
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,229
The hooligan has skill.

247
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:48,190
He'll be the perfect warm up
after our 300-year nap.

248
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:55,782
This one's flesh belongs to me!

249
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:59,077
I love the way cartilage
bursts between my teeth!

250
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,620
Another zombie!

251
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:05,040
This is no place for pawns.

252
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,880
<i>W-What speed!</i>

253
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:15,589
Master Dio, the spirit of
this young man is admirable!

254
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:20,636
I ask for the privilege of
putting an end to his life!

255
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,309
As you will.

256
00:18:23,768 --> 00:18:25,644
Tarukus, stand aside.

257
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:32,189
The Dark Knight Blueford!
What ferociousness! What savagery!

258
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:37,819
He radiates skill and pride!

259
00:18:38,783 --> 00:18:43,204
This is uncanny.
I learned about him in school.

260
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,624
And now he's coming to kill me.

261
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:50,878
I must steady my breathing
and relax my muscles!

262
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:59,846
The bastard! He's hiding his arms
behind his back!

263
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:03,265
Which will he attack with?
Or will he kick?

264
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,853
<i>Incredible! He wields the sword
with his hair!</i>

265
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,521
N-No!

266
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:13,985
Perceptive fellow.

267
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,696
He was able to dodge
my Danse Macabre hair.

268
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,738
How intriguing!

269
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,033
Mr. Joestar!

270
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:26,664
This is bad!
He can't breathe down there!

271
00:19:26,706 --> 00:19:28,749
He can't use the Hamon!

272
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,417
We have to do something!

273
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,795
T-Tarukus!

274
00:19:32,837 --> 00:19:36,549
Blast it!
We can't help Mr. Joestar!

275
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:42,889
This fight is over.
Blueford is unstoppable underwater.

276
00:19:43,264 --> 00:19:46,684
My supervision is
no longer needed here.

277
00:19:46,726 --> 00:19:51,021
I'll turn Windknight's Lot
into a town of zombies!

278
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:55,689
In just one day and one night, they will
spread to the whole of England!

279
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:08,623
<i>I-I need to breathe
to create Hamon!</i>

280
00:20:08,706 --> 00:20:10,207
<i>Just one breath!</i>

281
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,127
Go! Swim to the surface!

282
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:15,046
We are equally matched.

283
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:18,424
You can't breathe,
and my armor weighs me down.

284
00:20:18,758 --> 00:20:20,134
I won't use my sword.

285
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:22,470
We shall duel as heroes!

286
00:20:24,347 --> 00:20:27,850
Make your move
before you drown!

287
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:32,105
<i>Can I make it to the surface
before he does?</i>

288
00:20:32,355 --> 00:20:33,981
<i>What are my odds?</i>

289
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:38,402
<i>Then, in the throes of death,</i>

290
00:20:38,444 --> 00:20:42,906
<i>from deep within his psyche,
an explosive power ventured!</i>

291
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:48,367
<i>Another man would have struggled
toward the surface in agony</i>

292
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,831
<i>But JoJo was different.</i>

293
00:20:51,457 --> 00:20:55,957
<i>He swam deeper,
to the bottom of the lake bed!</i>

294
00:20:56,504 --> 00:20:58,839
W-What is he thinking?

295
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:05,012
<i>Hmm? Danny won't
let go of your toy gun?</i>

296
00:21:05,096 --> 00:21:08,265
<i>It's because you're trying
to take it away</i>

297
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,312
<i>Change your thinking.
Try giving it to Danny instead</i>

298
00:21:17,358 --> 00:21:20,527
<i>Windknight's Lot is a coal town.</i>

299
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,531
<i>That means the ground
settled long ago.</i>

300
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:25,491
<i>There!</i>

301
00:21:26,242 --> 00:21:29,995
<i>There must be a rock with air trapped
beneath it from when it was above water!</i>

302
00:21:30,663 --> 00:21:31,664
<i>I found it!</i>

303
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:36,336
<i>With this one breath…
Cut finely, beat of my blood!</i>

304
00:21:36,961 --> 00:21:38,420
I-Impossible!

305
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,174
<i>The tables have turned on you!</i>

306
00:21:42,675 --> 00:21:46,178
<i>Hamon travels
easily through water!</i>

307
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:48,222
<i>Underwater…</i>

308
00:21:48,723 --> 00:21:53,223
<i>Turquoise Blue Overdrive!</i>

309
00:23:26,821 --> 00:23:28,823
{\an8}NEXT EPISODE

310
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,867
Blueford is a mess!

311
00:23:30,908 --> 00:23:32,659
I'm a master of slaughter!

312
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,120
This pain is nothing.

313
00:23:34,203 --> 00:23:36,580
You will be destined to die.

314
00:23:36,622 --> 00:23:39,791
Life Magnetism Overdrive!
